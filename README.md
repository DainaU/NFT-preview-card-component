## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

That I need a lot of things to work on and was getting confused with css again... I tried my best.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="container1">
        <img class="main-img" src="/images/image-equilibrium.jpg">
        <div>
          <img class="overlay" src="/images/icon-view.svg"/>
        </div>
      </div>
```
```css
.overlay {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    opacity: 0;
    background-color: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.256);
    color: white;
    border-radius: 10px;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

```

### Continued development

I need to learn css more and how to put two images on top of eachother and two text paragraph on the same line but on opposite sides and so much more... I will update this in the future.
